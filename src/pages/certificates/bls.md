I undertook this essential training to ensure I'm fully prepared for emergency situations in the hospital setting. Through this course, I learned and practiced crucial life-saving techniques, including:
- Performing high-quality chest compressions and rescue breaths
- Using an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) effectively
- Recognizing and responding to cardiac and respiratory emergencies
- Implementing the chain of survival in various scenarios

This training has boosted my confidence in handling critical situations, allowing me to provide immediate and potentially life-saving care to patients in distress.
